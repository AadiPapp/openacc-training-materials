These two states are represented by arrays **`A`** and **`Anew`** respectively. The following is a visual representation of these arrays, with the top edge \"heated\".\n",

If we attempted to calculate in-place (using only **`A`**), then each element would calculate its new temperature based on the updated temperature of previous elements. This data dependency not only prevents parallelizing the code, but would also result in incorrect results when run in serial. By calculating into the temporary array **`Anew`** we ensure that an entire step of our simulation has completed before updating the **`A`** array.\n",

A reduction takes all of the values of `error` calculated in the loops and *reduces* them down to a single answer, in this case the maximum. There are a variety of reductions that can be done, but for our example code we only care about the max operation.
